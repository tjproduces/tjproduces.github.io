            <h2>Totally a Weather Article</h2>
            <p>This is some sweet filler text and you can't judge me for not wanting to use the loriem epsom salts or whatever that 
                thing is called. Do you like your bacon crispy or cooked a little less? Personally I think it depends 
                on what you're going to eat it with. Like if it's just a strip by itself, crispy all the way. If it's on 
                a burger, however, I would like it cooked less than crispy so I can avoid the possibilty of stabbing the roof 
                of my mouth whilst enjoying some juicy beef, you feel me on that?</p> 
            <p>Anyways, I'm trying way hard to catch up on this 
                class, it's been a headache and a half to keep up on my classes as my kiddo hasn't been feeling super well lately. Nothing 
                super serious, mainly just tummy aches and stuff like that. Since my wife works full-time, I'm on kid duty till about 4pm 
                each day. When my kiddo isnt feeling good, she only naps if I'm holding her. Don't get me wrong, it melts my heart that she 
                falls asleep in my arms, but it's not particularly easy to code with one arm while she sleeps. Anywho! Enough of my pitty 
                party! Let's just act like this was all about the weather (honestly IDK how someone could write this much about the sun or rain 
                and keep someone's attention).</p>
