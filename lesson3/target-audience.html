    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>GoWeatherBoy will be designed with a simple, minimalistic approach at a user's 
        first glance. If the user wants more detailed information, they can choose to
        dive deeper. This being said, the target audience will be people who want the
        most basic (but important) information presented without fluff. I can't think 
        of a more proper term for it, but basically people who aren't weather geeks.

    <h2>Meet Donnie, The Traveling Entrepreneur</h2>
    <h3>25 Years Young | Traveler | More than likely into dropshipping</h3>
    <p>Donnie prefers GoWeatherBoy because of its minimalistic, sleek, modern design. 
        Sometimes he gets curious about that thing called "Precipitation" because it 
        makes him feel like a genius to know about it, but not often enough to warrant 
        throwing that info at him right away.

    <h2>Meet Emily, The Business Major</h2>
    <h3>21 Years Young | Student | Hangs with the gals every weekend, because you can do that if you study business.</h3>
    <p>Why does Emily prefer GoWeatherBoy? Because all she needs to know is if the sun 
        will be out next weekend when her and her girlfriends go hit the dunes.</p>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <h3>Why GoWeatherBoy over other weather sites?</h3>
    <h3>I like to use my phone more than my computer, it's quicker.</h3>
    <h3>I'm planning a last minute trip to the dunes, will it rain?</h3>
    <h3>I can't stand loads of information in my face at once, will this site tick me off?</h3>
    <h3>What can I do around me with the current weather situation?</h3>
